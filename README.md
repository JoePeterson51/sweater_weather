# Sweater Weather
## About this Project
Sweater Weather is a fictional backend for an application to plan road trips. This app will allow users to see the current weather as well as the forecasted weather at the destination and also search nearby breweries and what the current weather is for that location.
The front-end will communicate with the back-end through an API. The goal of this project is to build and expose that API in a way that satisfies the front-end teamâ€™s requirements using service oriented architecture.

## Getting Started
## Versioning
- Ruby 2.7.2
- Rails 5.2.6
## Setup
First you'll need to:
`bundle install`
`rails db{:drop,:create,:migrate}`

Next we install Figaro.
`bundle exec figaro install`

Figaro allows us to discretely place our API keys inside of our local files. Only you'll be able to see this file, which helps for keeping API keys secret.

Once you have Figaro installed, verify that you have an `application.yml` file in your `config` folder. The directory of the `application.yml` file should be `config/application.yml`.  For more documentation on Figaro, please see [here](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro).

Congratulations! Basic setup is now complete.

This app will require you to get 3 API keys to place in your `application.yml` file.

1. [Register for the open weather API key](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up). Please be advised: Though you may receive your API key immediately, it may take a few hours for the key to be activated.

In your `application.yml` file put `FORCAST_API_KEY: <API KEY>`

2. [Register for the MapQuest's Geocoding API key](https://developer.mapquest.com/plan_purchase/steps/business_edition/business_edition_free/register)

In your `application.yml` file put `GEO_CODE_API_KEY: <API KEY>`

3. [Register for the Unsplash API key](https://unsplash.com/developers)

In your `application.yml` file put `UNSPLASH_API_KEY: <API KEY>`

That should take care of getting your weather, geocode, and background image API services!

And that should be all you need to finish installation!
## Running the tests
RSpec testing suite is utilized for testing this application.
 - Run the RSpec suite to ensure everything is passing as expected
`bundle exec rspec`
## Endpoints
The following are all API endpoints. Note, some endpoints have optional or required query parameters.
- All endpoints run off base connector http://localhost:3000 on local.
- Example responses can be seen after endpoints.
